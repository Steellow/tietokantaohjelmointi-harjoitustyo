Assignment was to create a web app with at least one database table with CRUD functionality. I used Express, React and MySQL (via phpMyAdmin).

- Backend
  - Queries to create the database: [database.sql](backend/database.sql)
  - Run backend server with `npm start` (in backend directory)
    - Make sure you have Apache and MySQL running from xampp
  - Run frontend with `npm start` (in frontend directory)

TODO:

- What to do when axios is still loading?
  - Placeholder library?
- Ability to add comments
- Admin interface?
- Better sample posts
